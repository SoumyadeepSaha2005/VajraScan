> "Shift-Left" Cloud Security Scanner optimized for Indian Regulatory Standards.

## Overview
VajraScan is an automated Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) security scanner designed to detect cloud misconfigurations before they are deployed. 

Unlike global tools, VajraScan is built with a "Compliance-First" approach for the Indian market, mapping security failures directly to the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act and RBI Cybersecurity Framework.

## Key Features

* **Indian Context Awareness:** Maps vulnerabilities like "Public S3 Buckets" directly to DPDP Act (Section 8) violations.
* **Auto-Remediation:** Does not just find errors; suggests the exact Terraform code to fix them.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Automatically blocks deployment pipelines (GitHub Actions) if insecure code is detected.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A visual interface built with Streamlit for non-technical auditors.

## Tech Stack
* **Core Engine:** Python (Logic & Parsing)
* **Parsing Library:** python-hcl2 (Terraform analysis)
* **UI/Dashboard:** Streamlit
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
